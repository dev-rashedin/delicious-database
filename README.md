## 1. Introduction

Databases are the backbone of every modern application. From small mobile apps to global-scale systems used by millions, databases store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently.

This repository, **Delicious Database**, is my personal learning journal — a structured but honest exploration of databases:
- From theory to practice
- From raw SQL to modern ORMs
- From relational to NoSQL
- From local databases to serverless cloud platforms

This is not a polished textbook.  
It is a **living document** — evolving as I learn.

## 2. A Brief History of Databases

### Early Days (1960s–1970s)
- Data stored in **flat files**
- Highly inefficient and error-prone
- Tight coupling between data and application logic

### Hierarchical & Network Databases
- IBM’s **IMS** (1966)
- Data organized as trees or graphs
- Rigid structure, hard to scale

### Relational Databases (1970s)
- Proposed by **Edgar F. Codd**
- Introduced tables, rows, columns
- Data queried using **SQL**
- Still dominant today

### Object-Oriented & NoSQL Era (2000s)
- Web-scale apps demanded flexibility
- Rise of document, key-value, and graph databases

### Cloud & Serverless Databases (2010s–present)
- Managed infrastructure
- Auto-scaling
- Pay-per-use
- Developer-first experience

## 3. What Is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data that allows:
- Efficient storage
- Fast retrieval
- Safe modification
- Concurrent access

Databases solve problems like:
- Data consistency
- Data integrity
- Performance at scale

## 4. Types of Databases

### SQL (Relational Databases)
- Structured schema
- Tables with relationships
- ACID compliance
- Strong consistency

### NoSQL Databases
- Flexible or schema-less
- Horizontal scaling
- Optimized for specific use cases

## 5. SQL Databases

### Common Characteristics
- Use Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Enforce schemas
- Excellent for transactional systems

### Major SQL Databases

#### SQLite
- Embedded database
- Zero configuration
- Ideal for mobile and small apps

#### PostgreSQL
- Advanced open-source RDBMS
- Strong consistency
- Rich feature set (JSON, extensions)

#### MySQL
- Widely used
- Popular with web apps
- Simpler than PostgreSQL

#### Oracle Database
- Enterprise-grade
- Expensive but powerful
- Used in large corporations
